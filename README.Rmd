## Manual
Please see [https://RavenGan.github.io/NIMMO/vignettes/Introduction.html](https://RavenGan.github.io/NIMMO/vignettes/Introduction.html) for details. In the introduction, we also include how to set up the python environment to run the function `NIMMO` and how to calculate the weights for each modality. In the R terminal, users can also use `?NIMMO` to access the help documents.

## Examples
In the [NIMMO tutorial](https://RavenGan.github.io/NIMMO/vignettes/Introduction.html), we use an examples to show the function and performance of NIMMO. One example dataset is also included in NIMMO package.
